Team Overt
Solution for Karnataka State Police Datathon 2024:

Our solution, Overt Flow is a proactive traffic management 
system, set to revolutionize the way we approach traffic 
management in India, starting from Bangalore. Unlike existing 
platforms like Google Maps and Waze, which focus mainly on 
post-congestion navigation, our system takes a proactive 
approach by addressing potential congestion triggers before 
they escalate into major traffic jams.
