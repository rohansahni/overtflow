Our solution, Overt Flow is a proactive traffic management 
system, set to revolutionize the way we approach traffic 
management in India, starting from Bangalore. Unlike existing 
platforms like Google Maps and Waze, which focus mainly on 
post-congestion navigation, our system takes a proactive 
approach by addressing potential congestion triggers before 
they escalate into major traffic jams. 
By empowering drivers who are in the vicinity of 100 meters of 
a junction to report issues such as improperly parked vehicles 
and potholes in real-time, we aim to collaborate with 
authorities to swiftly resolve these issues and ensure 
smoother journeys for everyone on the road.

 Proactive Incident Reporting: Drivers are empowered via incentive points 
(like in CRED app) to report issues such as improperly parked vehicles and 
potholes in real-time via our intuitive app interface.
 ● Automated Priority Assignment: Complaints are prioritized based on the 
number of reports received in a particular area, ensuring timely resolution 
of high-priority issues.
 ● Swift Notification to Authorities: Once a complaint reaches the threshold 
of 5 reports, the nearest police personnel are notified immediately for swift 
action.
 ● Real-Time Task Tracking: The app tracks the status of reported issues in 
real-time, providing users with updates on the progress of resolution 
efforts.
 ● Dynamic Rerouting Suggestions: In cases where potential congestion 
triggers cannot be resolved immediately, drivers are provided with dynamic 
rerouting suggestions to avoid affected areas.

#### Summary:
The Proactive Traffic Management System represents a paradigm shift in how we approach traffic management in India. By 
focusing on pre-congestion events and empowering drivers to report potential triggers in real-time, we aim to collaborate 
with authorities to ensure smoother journeys for everyone on the road. Our project aims to develop an intelligent system for 
leveraging modern technologies to detect and manage traffic bottlenecks caused by accidents effectively. By utilizing 
real-time data and smart algorithms, our system will streamline communication with authorities, provide timely rerouting 
suggestions to drivers, and ultimately enhance road safety and traffic flow.
 With advanced strategies and seamless integration with existing infrastructure, our solution is poised to make a significant 
impact on road safety and traffic flow in India. It's a practical solution to the challenges of traffic management. Combining 
the best elements of crowd-sourced reporting with advanced incident management and traffic simulation, we are confident 
that our approach will make a real impact on road safety and traffic flow.
